This is an application whose basic function is to return to the user GIFs of their favorite celebrities.

## Usage

We have provided a few stock celebrities for users to get an idea of what they can get from our application
At the top, we have a search bar where users can add to the list of celebrities they can find GIFs for
When a user searches for a new celebrity, that new celebrity will be added as to keep a running record in addition to a set of GIFs being returned for that celebrity of interest
Previously added celebrities can be reaccessed for their associated GIFs
As to not overload the browser window, we have implemented an on-click functionality to our GIF photos. Initially, all GIFs are rendered as still images. When the user clicks on a still GIF image, it will switch over to the GIF clip (traditional moving GIFs as we know it)
Importance This app provides some additional funcitonality in comparison to the GIPHY UI:

By maintaining a history of recently searched celebrities, users can see and revisit their GIFs searches
